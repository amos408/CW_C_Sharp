//Integers: Recreation One
//1, 246, 2, 123, 3, 82, 6, 41 are the divisors of number 246. Squaring these divisors we get: 1, 60516, 4, 15129, 9, 6724, 36, 1681. 
//The sum of these squares is 84100 which is 290 * 290.
//Task

//Find all integers between m and n (m and n integers with 1 <= m <= n) such that the sum of their squared divisors is itself a square.

//We will return an array of subarrays or of tuples (in C an array of Pair) or a string. 
//The subarrays (or tuples or Pairs) will have two elements: first the number the squared divisors of which is a square and then the sum of the squared divisors.
//Example:

//list_squared(1, 250) --> [[1, 1], [42, 2500], [246, 84100]]
//list_squared(42, 250) --> [[42, 2500], [246, 84100]]

//The form of the examples may change according to the language, see "Sample Tests".
//Note

//In Fortran - as in any other language - the returned string is not permitted to contain any redundant trailing whitespace: 
//you can use dynamically allocated character strings.
